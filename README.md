# Interactive-Statistics
Shiny App for interactive data display, analysis and scatter plot visualization

## Description
The app is developed using following R packages
1. [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) : A new way to build web applications in R
2. [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/): Javascript data visualization to R
3. [DT](http://rstudio.github.io/DT/): JavaScript/D3 chart library for htmlwidget
4. [metricsgraphics](): JavaScript/DataTables library for htmlwidget

## Usage
1. The app can be accessed online from [Shinyapps.io cloud](https://r-world.shinyapps.io/Interactive-Statistics/)
2. Download ui.R and server.R files in a folder and run the through RStudio. 
Note: Install the packages mentioned in description before running the app.

## Future Development
1. Development of customized apps for different types of data analysis and visualization
  * Visualizations: Line plot, Bar graphs, etc.
  * Statistical analysis: 
    * t-tests (single-sample, independent sample, paired)
    * one-/multi-way ANOVA 
    * Clustering (k-means, hierarchical) 
    * Principal component analysis 
    * etc.
2. Hosting/Sharing the apps 
  * In the cloud on [Shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/). Share the app by providing link to the app. Example: The Interactive-Statistics app can be accessed online from [Shinyapps.io cloud](https://r-world.shinyapps.io/Interactive-Statistics/)
  * By installing [Shiny server](http://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/)
  * Share through Git Hub

I have good knowledge of C, Java, Perl, Python and R. I am interested in development of software and tools for Life science researchers. 
In future, I would love to learn and teach programming and software development to empower the research in Life sciences. 

I am looking forward to learn new skills. Thank you!

*What I found hardest about using Git the first time was...*

Well, I found it difficult to memorize the commands for collaborative use of Git. I am going through online help documentation of Git and Git Hub to get familiar with this version control system. It is really helpful! I will get used to it after few more fork, clone, commit, push and pull requests.

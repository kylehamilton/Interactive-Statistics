# Interactive-Statistics
Shiny App for interactive data display, analysis and scatter plot visualization

## Description
The app is developed using following R packages
  1. [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) : A new way to build web applications in R
  2. [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/): JavaScript data visualization to R
  3. [DT](http://rstudio.github.io/DT/): JavaScript/D3 chart library for htmlwidget
  4. [metricsgraphics](): JavaScript/DataTables library for htmlwidget

## Usage
  1. The app can be accessed online from [Shinyapps.io cloud](https://r-world.shinyapps.io/Interactive-Statistics/)
  2. Install the packages mentioned in description section. Download ui.R and server.R files in a folder and run through R Studio. 
## Sample input files
  1. testIris.csv
  2. testMtcars.csv
## Future Development
1. Development of customized apps for different types of data analysis and visualization
  * Visualizations: 
    * Line plot, Bar graphs, etc.
    * Time series data chart
    * Network
    * 3D scatter plot
    * etc.
  * Statistical analysis: 
    * t-tests (single-sample, independent sample, paired)
    * one-/multi-way ANOVA 
    * Clustering (k-means, hierarchical) 
    * Principal component analysis 
    * etc.
2. Hosting/Sharing the apps 
  * In the cloud on [Shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/). Share the app by providing link to the app. 
  
    Example: The Interactive-Statistics app can be accessed online from [Shinyapps.io cloud](https://r-world.shinyapps.io/Interactive-Statistics/)
  * By installing [Shiny server](http://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/) 
  * Share through [Git Hub](http://github.com/)
